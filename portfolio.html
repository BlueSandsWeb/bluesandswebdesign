              <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Lambda Group Organizer started as a winning 2 day hackathon project that Lambda School requested we make production ready, which took a month to get to the beta version. This application fixes Lambda Schools trouble with signing students up for build weeks.  Previously they were using Google sheets in order to sign students up to projects. Now students can sign themselves up with minimal fuss and hassle for everyone involved!</p>
              <br>
              <p class="description">The application does live updates using websockets (through firebase). It also allows the administrator to add an entire build week using a csv, and then customize that build week as the signup process moves along.<p>
              <br>

              owned by Abby Sternburg. The website was created in 1994, but by 2018 Abby was ready for a design refresh.
              She requested that I keep almost all of the current content but wanted a new look.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="description">Abby wanted a website that would be easy to update and change herself.  This website was created using wordpress with a drag and drop builder placed on top to make things easy for her to update and change in the future, with some hand coded custom sections.<p>

            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> My second ever game application! I have had
              enough people enjoy playing it, I thought I would share even though the styling isn't quite finished. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.</p>
              <br>
            <p class="description">Keep in mind, this one is still in it's UI polishing phase, but it's a great example of what you can do with some computer science knowledge</p>

            <p class="description">Enjoy!</p>

            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> One of the first game applications I made! I have had
              enough people enjoy playing it, I thought I would share this one too. The point of the game is to guess which square
              tile is the correct color based on the red green blue (rgb) value given in the top bar. While you're
              there, feel free to have a look around at more of my work on codepen.io.</p>

            <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> My first website! This is what introduced me to web
              development in the first place. My wife wanted to create an authority site detailing care for rabbits. The
              two of us volunteered with local animal shelters and rescues and saw a need for reliable information that
              is easy to access for prospective rabbit owners and folks who feel out of their depth. To this day we
              continue to help out with rabbit rescues while tweaking the website.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="description">We setup a WordPress website with a default theme at first. We since have done some
              customization to the website and are working on another refresh of the entire site!</p>
