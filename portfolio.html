              <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Media Masters is a small business in Chantilly Virginia owned by Abby Sternburg.  The website was created in 1994, but by 2018 Abby was ready for a design refresh.  She requested that I keep almost all of the current content but wanted a new look.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="description">Because Media Masters is a video creation business, video is the main attraction on the website.  Have a look for yourself to see the upgrades!</p>

              <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> StrongBeautifulFearless.com was created for Melani Lucero, a health and life coach in Las Vegas Nevada.  She was just starting her business and was looking for direction.  I helped her figure out her target market and develop her minimal viable product for her website. Melani wanted a website that has bold colors and a very visual experience that is flexible and gives her the ability to change the website herself.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="description">Strong Beautiful Fearless was setup with a WordPress theme that is customizable for each post and page in a simple manner for Melani.  I also hand coded some portions of the website that needed customization beyond what the WordPress theme would allow.  Click the button to see the results.</p>

              <h3 class="title">The Bunny Guru</h3>
              <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> My first website!  This is what introduced me to web development in the first place.  My wife wanted to create an authority site detailing care for rabbits.  The two of us volunteered with local animal shelters and rescues and saw a need for reliable information that is easy to access for prospective rabbit owners and folks who feel out of their depth. To this day we continue to help out with rabbit rescues while tweaking the website.</p>
              <br>
              <p class="description">We setup a WordPress website with a default theme at first.  We since have done some customization to the website and are working on another refresh of the entire site!</p>

              <h3 class="title">The Great Color Game</h3>
              <p class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> One of the first game applications I made!  I have had enough people enjoy playing it, I thought I would share.  The point of the game is to guess which square tile is the correct color based on the red green blue (rgb) value given in the top bar.  While you're there, feel free to have a look around at more of my work on codepen.io.</p>
