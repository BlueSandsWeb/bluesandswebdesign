      <h1>Website Hosting and Domain Names Explained</h1>
      <p class="date">August 10, 2018 by Jon Bernal</p>
      
      <p class="description">Understanding the role of a hosting company when embarking on a website project can feel overwhelming. You are faced with tech lingo you may have never come across. The first thing to know is that purchasing a domain name and hosting package is essential for every website project, so I will explain the roles of each service to make sure you understand why you need to make these purchases.</p>

      <hr>


      <h3>Domain Name / Web Address</h3>
      
      <p>Each website has a unique domain name to identify it from the millions of other websites. For example, the domain name of this website is www.bluesandswebdesign.com. Domain names are also sometimes called ‘web addresses’ or ‘URLs’ (Uniform Resource Locations). Having a unique domain name for your company allows your audience to search for your website through Google or type it manually in your browser’s search bar. In order to get a domain name for your company, you will need to contact a hosting company who will set everything up for you.</p>

      <br>
     
      <h3>Hosting Package</h3>

      <p>Once you have obtained your domain name, you will need to purchase a hosting package. A website host or server is a space on the internet in which we can put your website’s files so that it will be visible to the public. It’s similar to having a folder on your computer’s desktop with files inside. A website host is simply a folder on your hosting company’s online server which contains your website’s files and makes them visible to the public.</p>

      <br>
     
      <h3>Recommended Hosting Packages</h3>

      <p>Most websites will work perfectly on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bluehost.com/products/shared">Bluehost's Shared hosting plan</a>. If you do not have a hosting package I would recommend that you go with Bluehost as they have outstanding customer support and I've never had any issues with them.  Just as an aside, I am not affiliated or paid by Bluehost.</p>

      <br>
     
      <h3>Online Store / eCommerce Hosting</h3>

      <p>If you are planning to sell products on your website using an eCommerce solution, Blue Host's hosting plan will also suit you perfectly if you are just starting and are not expecting huge volumes of business. However, if you are planning to sell a large number of products or will have a high volume of people visiting your website then you should opt for. If you’re unsure which hosting option is best for you or you need a plan that will work for a large web application please <a href="mailto:jon@bluesandswebdesign.com?subject=Help With Hosting Plans">contact me</a> before making a purchase.</p>

      <br>
     
      <h3>SSL Certificate</h3>

      <p>If you are planning to allow your customers to purchase products on your website using a credit card then you will be required to have an SSL Certificate. An SSL certificate can be thought of as a lock-box for your data. It doesn’t make it any harder for anyone to obtain the data but it encrypts the data to the point that nobody can understand it. In addition to encrypting data, the SSL certificate ensures visitors that your business is legitimate, and will not attempt to defraud them in any way. Bluehost offers free SSL with all of their hosting plans through <a target="_blank" href="https://letsencrypt.org/about/">Let's Encrypt</a>.</p>
