        <h1>Keeping Your WordPress Website Secure</h1>

        <p class="date">August 10, 2018 by Jon Bernal</p>
        
        <p class="description">From time to time WordPress websites get attacked by hackers. Prevention and monthly maintenance is the best way to avoid and foil an attack. I always ensure that every WordPress website I create is using the latest version of WordPress and that all plugins are up-to-date when the website is ready to launch. However, without monthly maintenance your website could be missing out on crucial WordPress version updates and also vulnerabilities in outdated plugins may become evident.</p>

        <h3>Backing up all of your website’s content and database</h3>
        
        <p>Without a doubt, keeping an up to date backup of all of your website’s files, content and database is the safest way to ensure that your website will always be safe. No matter what happens you will always have a saved version of the website to pop back up online at any time. I usually recommend that all of the website’s content is backed up every 1 – 4 weeks based on how often new content is added.</p>

        <br>
       
        <h3>Updating your website’s WordPress version</h3>

        <p>WordPress sporadically releases version updates and it’s important that your website is always using the latest version. Most of the time the version updates are to increase security and remove any vulnerabilities. It’s vital to ensure you have a complete backup of your website files, content and database before preforming a WordPress version update.</p>

        <br>
       
        <h3>Keeping your website’s plugins up-to-date</h3>

        <p>WordPress <a target="_blank" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins">plugins</a> are coded files which extend the basic functionality of your WordPress website. An example could be a plugin that adds a contact form to your website. Plugins are often written by independent developers and are released to the public through the <a href=""></a>WordPress Plugin Directory. Using plugins in custom WordPress websites is common practice amongst website developers and rarely cause problems as long as they are maintained and kept up-to-date.</p>

        <br>
       
<!--         <h3>WordPress Website Security Maintenance & Updates</h3>

        <p>I understand that manually updating your website’s WordPress version or updating your website’s plugins may be beyond your capabilities and therefore I offer monthly WordPress Website Security Maintenance & Updates.</p> -->
