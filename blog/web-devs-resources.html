      <h3>Mobile Device Testing</h3>
      
      <p>mobiletest.me allows you to preview your website within the boundaries of popular smart phones and tablets.</p>

      <p>Chrome also is great for mobile device testing.  If you open up chrome's dev tools (f12 or use the menu in the upper right corner), there is a button second from the upper left corner or press ctrl + shift + m.  This will allow you </p>

      <br>
     
      <h3>SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)</h3>

      <p>seositecheckup.com is definitely the best resource that I’ve come across so far for completely breaking down every aspect of a website’s SEO. I have greatly expanded my knowledge of SEO by testing websites with this resource and learning how to improve every aspect of the web development process.</p>

      <p>MOZ (formally known as SEO MOZ) is an excellent website for learning all there is to know about how to best optimise your website. They have a number of free resources for getting started and keeping on top of your website’s SEO.</p>

      <p>I would also recommend that anyone who is interested in getting started with SEO should read Google’s Search Engine Optimisation Starter Guide.</p>

      <br>
     
      <h3>Website Speed</h3>

      <p>tools.pingdom.com is a fantastic resource for testing a website’s speed and gives lots of helpful tips to improve areas in need of a fix-up.</p>

      <p>Google PageSpeed Insights is another resource for testing not only the website’s speed but also how the website’s content is prioritised, the size of tap targets and font legibility.</p>

      <br>
     
      <h3>Responsive Website Design</h3>

      <p>getbootstrap.com is a fundamental part of every website I develop and essential for responsive website design. It promotes clean, semantic code that encourages better coding from everyone who implements it.</p>

      <br>
     
      <h3>Free High-Res Stock Images</h3>

      <p>unsplash.com is updated every ten days with new free, high-res stock images. The quality is excellent and they have an extensive library of photos touching on various themes.</p>

      <br>

      <h3>Icons</h3>

      <p>FontAwesome  would definitely be my go-to icons for any website project. The font is available to download and install on your computer for use in Photoshop and there is also a web font available for use online. They are constantly updating the icon library.</p>

      <p>ionicons.com is another great website for free, open source icons.</p>

      <p>Dashicons are very useful within the WordPress administrative screen when creating Custom Post Types.</p>

      <br>

      <h3>Colors</h3>

      <p><a href="www.brandcolors.net">brandcolors.net</a> is great for ensuring you have the exact HEX value for Facebook, Twitter etc.</p>

      <p>Adobe Kuler is a wonderful website for creating colour schemes.</p>

      <p><a href="www.flatuicolorpicker.com"></a>flatuicolorpicker.com gives the HEX and RGB values for all of the colours within the flat colour scheme.</p>

      <br>

      <h3>CSS</h3>

      <p><a href="www.flatuicolorpicker.com"></a>flatuicolorpicker.com gives the HEX and RGB values for all of the colours within the flat colour scheme.</p>

      <br>

      <h3>HTML Newsletters</h3>

      <p>This tutorial is great for getting started with responsive HTML email newsletters. And this tutorial goes through creating a basic HTML email template from scratch.</p>

      <br>

      <h3>JavaScript Libraries</h3>

      <p><a href="www.flatuicolorpicker.com"></a>masonry.desandro.com is a grid layout JavaScript library that places elements in vertically in a masonry wall style layout.</p>

      <br>

      <h3>Books</h3>

      <p>There's a wide variety here.  A little something for everyone!</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          HTML&CSS design and build websites by Jon Duckett
          <p>A very visual book that does a great job of illustrating html tags and the visual uses of CSS.  I recommend it as a first book on HTML and CSS.  Solid on the basics.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          The Principles of Beautiful Web Design by Jason Beird
          <p>Great for programmers who want to work on their design skills and a side perk is that it's free!  I found it as a promotion from sitepoint.  I was suprised at how enjoyable it was to read and put to use!</p>
